The Student Grade Record Analyzer is a C-based system designed to record, organize, and analyze student grade information. It allows users to input student records, including ID, name, and grade. The system supports deleting records by specifying a student ID, as well as undoing deletions to restore previously removed entries. Additionally, it provides sorting functions based on either ID or grade in both ascending and descending order. Users can also search for a specific student by entering their ID, and the system can display all existing student records along with their corresponding details. The system uses array, stack push and pop, insertion sort, linear search, and linked list to manage the students’ record efficiently.
